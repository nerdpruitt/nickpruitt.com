<p>I love <a href="http://www.creativemornings.com">Creative Mornings</a>. Creative Mornings is a monthly lecture series for creative-type folks. They take place all over the world, and they&rsquo;re all available on Vimeo for free. That means you have no excuse not to watch them.</p>

<p>I wrote down some notes from <a href="http://vimeo.com/28150404">Jason Fried’s talk</a> a few months ago, and then never published them because I&rsquo;m a wimp and second guess everything I want to put on this site. So without further adieu, here are my notes. You should go watch this and take your own notes too. Better yet, find a way to put some of these excellent ideas into action.</p>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>Your problems are not unique. Scratching your own itch and solving those problems, solves it for everyone else who faces the same thing. Also, when your product solves your own problems you know whether or not it’s good.</li>
	<li>When you fund your own company and work and rely on yourself, no one else can tell you what to do.</li>
	<li>Self-initiated projects show if it’s just a job or part of your life. They show if you really enjoy what you do.</li>
	<li>Interrupting someone says that what you have to say to them is more important than what they are working on.</li>
	<li>Treat your office like a library. Create an environment where you can learn and get things done.</li>
	<li>You don’t have a craftsman who builds furniture and hones his craft for 30 years, and then he goes and manages other craftsman doing the same thing. The same should be true for your company and your workers.</li>
	<li>When people are happier, they’re going to do better work</li>
	<li>Implementing REWORK in a corporate setting: Get projects done using the methodology and let others take notice.</li>
	<li>Working in a corporate environment is okay. If you like it stay; if you don’t work somewhere else.</li>
	<li>When you say no, say no early. No one wants to work on something for 3 months and then kill it. No is No to one thing; Yes is No to a lot of things.</li>
	<li>Recognize your creative times and utilize them wisely. </li>
	<li>When you work on something you don’t like, it’s not going to be any good.</li>
	<li>If you have a unique point of view, and do something in a different way, you can handle the competition.</li>
	<li>Build something that solves problems, not something that meets specs.</li>
	<li>Less is always an option.</li>
</ul>
