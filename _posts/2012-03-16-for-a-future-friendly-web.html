<blockquote><p>Future-friendly thinking encompasses lots of ideas: web standards, content strategy, progressive enhancement, responsive design, and more. However, it&rsquo;s far bigger than any one approach, technology or technique. It&rsquo;s here to help us think beyond our current project scopes and help us prepare for a future filled with innovation and constant change.</p></blockquote>

<p>Have a vision and strategy that serves your users well, code flexibly with a solid structure, and embrace opportunities to make things better for others today and in the future.</p>
