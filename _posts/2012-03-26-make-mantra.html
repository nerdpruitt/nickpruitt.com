<p>When I start sketching ideas for a design, I always simply list the purpose of the project I’m working on and the main problems I’m solving and objectives I’m working to accomplish. I think a mission statement for your product is important, which is basically what a Make Mantra is, but it’s more direct with only a few words. I think a Make Mantra for whatever I'm working on will be added to the growing post-it note collection on my desk.</p>
