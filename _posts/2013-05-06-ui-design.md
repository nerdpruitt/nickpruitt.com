<blockquote>
    <p>You can define UI very precisely. An interface is a place where two things meet: the human and the computer. The computer has functions it can perform. The human needs inputs and outputs to take advantage of those functions. The interface is the arrangement
    of inputs and outputs that enable people to apply the computerâ€™s functions to create outcomes they want.</p>
