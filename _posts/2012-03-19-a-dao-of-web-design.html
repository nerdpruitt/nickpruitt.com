<p>This article was written twelve years ago for <a href="http://www.alistapart.com">A List Apart</a> by <a href="http://johnfallsopp.com">John Allsopp</a>, and it rings especially true today amid all the discussion of responsive and adaptive web design and mobile first. Really these things are just pieces of truly building an accessible and flexible web for our users. I think we have come full circle to where we started. We have a better idea what is ahead of us, and even then, we are only at the beginning. Here are some of my favorite quotes from the article.</p>

<blockquote><p>The control which designers know in the print medium, and often desire in the web medium, is simply a function of the limitation of the printed page. We should embrace the fact that the web doesn’t have the same constraints, and design for this flexibility.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The flexibility I’ve talked about so far I think of as “adaptability“. Everything I’ve said so far could be summarized as: make pages which are adaptable. Make pages which are accessible, regardless of the browser, platform or screen that your reader chooses or must use to access your pages.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The web’s greatest strength, I believe, is often seen as a limitation, as a defect. It is the nature of the web to be flexible, and it should be our role as designers and developers to embrace this flexibility, and produce pages which, by being flexible, are accessible to all.</p></blockquote>
