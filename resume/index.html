        <h1>My Objective</h1>

        <p>To work among passionate people who want to create web experiences and products that are helpful, elegant, delightful, and beautiful. Coincidentally, I've also always wanted to work for a company that mentions Garey Busey in at least one job description.</p>

        <h2>About Yours Truly</h2>
        <p>One part of me is a graphic and user interface designer (see Ryan Singer's <a href="/2013/05/06/ui-design/#main">definition of UI Design</a>, which I'm kind of in love with), believing that usability, a sound concept, the meeting of strategic goals, and the communication of messages and ideas are at the core of good design. I especially enjoy typography and working with the grid. Yeah, I'm one of those annoying people that are always criticizing typeface choices everywhere I go.</p>

        <p>I am also one part front end developer. I am an expert in "cutting edge" HTML and CSS (meaning HTML5 and CSS3), and I am familiar with writing HTML and CSS for large sites and large networks of sites. I've been building and experimenting with responsive design (or as I call it, web design) pretty much since I read <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/fluidgrids">this article</a>. I'm also pretty dang handy with JavaScript, with a particular love for utilizing the jQuery framework alongside good ol' plain JavaScript, which is actually an oddly beautiful programming language. I'm not going to throw a bunch of plugins on a page, I'm going to write what is needed and it's going to be clear, efficient, and all around awesome. But if you call me a ninja or a wizard I will throw my coffee in your face.</p>

        <p>Lastly, I am in a team lead position with my current employer, and I wrote a <a href="/2013/05/03/team-manifesto/#main">manifesto</a>, a set of principles that I wanted our team to live by. They sum up how I view work quite well, which I'm sure you're dying to know.</p>

        <h3>Coffee</h3>
        <p>I freaking love coffee. Like in the I hate Starbucks and love my Hario V60, Aeropress, Chemex, and Espro Press kind of way. My 2-year-old son saw an auto drip coffee maker while we were on vacation recently, and he had to ask me what it was because he had never seen one before.</p>

        <h1>Work Experience</h1>

        <h2>LifeWay</h2>
        <span class="time">2011&ndash;Present</span>
        <p>I've done a bit of everything, from user testing to design to front end development to working in WebSphere Commerce (shudder) to coding responsive HTML emails. I've really had an opportunity to hone my JavaScript skills and my approach to writing HTML and CSS. I have been the sole designer and developer on projects, where I am collaborating with the business and internal stakeholders. I have led UX projects on LifeWay.com, being the sole designer and developer, or collaborating with backend developers and/or other designers in regular iterations of work on LifeWay.com. I also saw a gap in our email marketing, and created our first responsive emails.</p>

        <h2>HCA</h2>
        <span class="time">2007&ndash;2011</span>
        <p>I started at HCA managing all the websites for two divisions of the company, totaling about 50 sites. I led projects, designed and developed websites, and trained people in how to use our proprietary CMS. I was then recruited to the corporate Communication &amp; Design department. I  was on a project to migrate all of HCA&rsquo;s websites&mdash;we were responsible for roughly 600 sites for all of our facilities across the country&mdash;to a new content management system called dotCMS.</p>
        <p>I was an integral part of creating the architecture and framework for this network of sites, both in creating coding standards for our team and in planning how to manage our vast network of sites. Using the frameworks we put into place, we successfully launched 300 websites in 7 months. I developed new functionality in dotCMS for our sites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Apache Velocity. I also wrote documentation for everything that I created and taught people how to use it.</p>

        <h2>Independent Web Designer and Developer</h2>
        <span class="time">2006&ndash;Present</span>
        <p>Since I started learning web stuff back in college I've been doing freelance work and side projects. This has ranged across a broad variety of clients. Lately, I've been focused on doing various small front end development and HTML email work for a local company called <a href="http://www.abenity.com">Abenity</a>&mdash;I think your employee perks are provided through them, actually.</p>

            <p>Here is some recent stuff I have done. If poking through source code is your thing, you can check out <a href="https://github.com/nerdpruitt/nickpruitt.com/tree/master/work">my GitHub profile</a>.</p>

                <h2><a href="#">TGP</a></h2>
                <p>This is an announcement site that I created for a new curriculum that debuted last year. The purpose of this site was to describe the curriculum overall and to encourage signups for the pilot. I was given artwork and branding guidelines and was responsible for the design and front end code. You can make fun of me for the parallax effects if you want, but we were successful in getting lots of signups.</p>

                <h2>SASSPoole</h2>
                <p>This is a work in progress, but I thought it would be fun to share. This is a collaboration with a friend of mine. We are picking apart, combining, extending, deleting, and studying various SASS frameworks, to create our own SASS library/boilerplate-type-thingy , powered by things we understand and will actually use. It's still not 100% complete, but could be interesting for you to look at and have a glimpse into my mind.</p>

                <h2>Orthodoxy</h2>
                <p>I am a huge fan of G.K. Chesterton, so I started putting my favorite book of his online, a perk of liking authors whose works are mostly in the public domain. I used Gridset to design the grid (just add <code>?gridset=show</code> to any page to see the grid) based upon the golden ratio and Typekit to serve up the excellent Minion Pro. The creator of Gridset, Mark Boulton, even retweeted this when I talked about it on Twitter, possibly causing a star struck giggle to come from my mouth. This is what I do for fun.</p>

                <h2>Responsive Email</h2>
                <p>Our email views have grown to about 50/50 between desktop and mobile, so I took the existing email design and made it responsive. This was my first attempt at a responsive email, and I blogged about the process of building it <a href="http://nickpruitt.com/2013/01/28/responsive-email/#main">here</a>. We use Litmus, and shared the post with them. They tweeted it out and want to use it as a part of a guide on responsive email that is in the works, thus making me feel validated as a human being.</p>
