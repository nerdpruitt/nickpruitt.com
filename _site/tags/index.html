</blockquote><p>When I start sketching ideas for a design, I always simply list the purpose of the project I’m working on and the main problems I’m solving and objectives I’m working to accomplish. I think a mission statement for your product is important, which is basically what a Make Mantra is, but it’s more direct with only a few words. I think a Make Mantra for whatever I'm working on will be added to the growing post-it note collection on my desk.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/a-new-make-mantra-a-statement-of-design-intent">Mark Boulton</a> discussing how simply writing what you must do on a project is an important tool.</p><p>This article was written twelve years ago for <a href="http://www.alistapart.com">A List Apart</a> by <a href="http://johnfallsopp.com">John Allsopp</a>, and it rings especially true today amid all the discussion of responsive and adaptive web design and mobile first. Really these things are just pieces of truly building an accessible and flexible web for our users. I think we have come full circle to where we started. We have a better idea what is ahead of us, and even then, we are only at the beginning. Here are some of my favorite quotes from the article.</p>

<blockquote><p>The control which designers know in the print medium, and often desire in the web medium, is simply a function of the limitation of the printed page. We should embrace the fact that the web doesn’t have the same constraints, and design for this flexibility.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The flexibility I’ve talked about so far I think of as “adaptability“. Everything I’ve said so far could be summarized as: make pages which are adaptable. Make pages which are accessible, regardless of the browser, platform or screen that your reader chooses or must use to access your pages.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The web’s greatest strength, I believe, is often seen as a limitation, as a defect. It is the nature of the web to be flexible, and it should be our role as designers and developers to embrace this flexibility, and produce pages which, by being flexible, are accessible to all.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Future-friendly thinking encompasses lots of ideas: web standards, content strategy, progressive enhancement, responsive design, and more. However, it&rsquo;s far bigger than any one approach, technology or technique. It&rsquo;s here to help us think beyond our current project scopes and help us prepare for a future filled with innovation and constant change.</p></blockquote>

<p>Have a vision and strategy that serves your users well, code flexibly with a solid structure, and embrace opportunities to make things better for others today and in the future.</p><blockquote>

  <h4 class="low-top"><a href="/tags/life">life</a> (<p>Throughout my short professional career I&rsquo;ve always thought of myself as living two lives. There&rsquo;s the world at work at the office with paychecks and cubicles and things I have to do, and the world that is all the other things in my life, my friends and family and hobbies, all the things I really enjoy. Work is this compartmentalized, self-contained thing that I have to do for forty hours a week simply because to function in society you must have money and therefore you must have a job. I&rsquo;ve always found my jobs ultimately disappointing and unfulfilling, but told myself that it&rsquo;s okay because it&rsquo;s just this thing I have to do, and I can leave it behind each day when I get home. But that never really worked for me if I&rsquo;m truly honest with myself, and I now realize I couldn&rsquo;t be more wrong in regard to this philosophy.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that I hate the profession I&rsquo;m in by any means. In fact, I love being a web designer, which to me is one part design and one part code. As I sat in my Drawing 3 class in college, and we began discussing whether or not spilled coffee on the carpet is in fact a drawing, I knew one hundred percent that I was a designer. I have enjoyed design from the moment I took my first course in it and started learning what it actually is, but in this moment for the first time I called myself a designer. I didn&rsquo;t want to sit and contemplate the spilled coffee, I wanted to solve problems and meet needs and goals.</p>

<div class="note out one-alt">
	<p>Yes, we really talked about spilled coffee being a drawing. After all, it makes a mark on a surface. I think I called it a mistake and a tragedy (because of wasted coffee), not a drawing.</p>
</div>

<p>Then there&rsquo;s the other half of my job, the coding. At my last job I was in a pure development position for about a year and a half. As I was learning more about actual programming and scripting, something hit me—I love programming too. The more I learn about it, the more I love it. That you can write a function to solve a problem, pass it some arguments, and then it always gives you the same result—that&rsquo;s beautiful to me. I have coded for years, and always enjoyed writing HTML and CSS and JavaScript, but now as the web has matured, the capabilities at our hands have matured too, and it affords some amazing opportunities. Opportunities to learn something new every day, and to improve our craft each day. I love it.</p>

<p>So after this love fest, where does the whole realization and being wrong part come in? Well, I love my profession but not necessarily the conditions in which I&rsquo;ve practiced it. I realize that I&rsquo;ve always just sought a J-O-B, a paycheck, security, etc. I&rsquo;ve never been all that intentional with choosing where I want to work. I find something available, convince myself that it&rsquo;s tolerable, and go for it. Then I end up being tired, stressed, and miserable at work. Then I feel guilty for that because shouldn&rsquo;t I just be happy that I have a job and a paycheck, and why can&rsquo;t I be just like everyone else and realize a job is just a necessary thing in life, and after all I can go do it and leave it behind each day when I walk in the door at home. Not feeling fulfilled and feeling guilty because of feeling guilty for not feeling fulfilled is a weird little conundrum of a situation.</p>

<p>Then I read an awesome book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Quitter-Jon-Acuff/dp/0982986270/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1330825488&sr=8-1"><i>Quitter</i></a>, by <a href="http://jonacuff.com">Jon Acuff</a>, and he, being a far better writer than I am, nailed how I&rsquo;ve always felt about my forty hour hour dilemma. It&rsquo;s really quite simple: what you do at work does affect what you do at home. You have one life, and your work is a big chunk of it.</p>

<p>Just come out and admit it. It is a big part of your life, and it affects you. If you took any other activity and told someone that you spent forty hours a week doing it, that you spent the majority of your waking hours each day doing it, that you let it take you away from your family and anything else you might spend that time doing, and then at the end said, "Yeah, but it isn&rsquo;t really part of my life,"&mdash;that person would think your nuts. So why use this argument with our jobs?</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t listen in meetings at work and tune it out, then you don&rsquo;t listen to your wife when you&rsquo;re at home because you tune her out. If you sit zoned out staring at a computer screen all day, then you sit zoned out staring at your television at night. If you&rsquo;re lazy at work, then you&rsquo;ll be lazy in every other aspect of your life. You just can&rsquo;t separate it. Your life is one complete thing.</p>

<p>So now what do I do, equipped with my new knowledge? I don&rsquo;t have that totally figured out, but I do know that I must work, work, work. After I read <i>Quitter</i> over this past Christmas, I decided that I&rsquo;m tired of having a pile of work that I don&rsquo;t do but want to do. I&rsquo;m tired of only saying that I want to do more freelance work and spend time learning more about my craft. I&rsquo;m actually going to do it.  I&rsquo;ve gotten up at 5am every weekday and put in an hour of learning and work before I start the eight hour day ahead of me. Most days I spend lunch reading and learning new skills instead of going out to lunch. And I continue to try my best to push my work more and more with each project at the day job. I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;ll end up, but I&rsquo;m not stopping. I&rsquo;ve already found that being more diligent and intentionally putting time into the things that I&rsquo;ve always said matter to me gives me more energy and makes me feel less aimless. It&rsquo;s time to stop sitting around and wasting time. I feel more awake than ever. We&rsquo;ll see what happens from here.</p><blockquote>

So without further adieu, here are my notes. You should go watch this and take your own notes too. Better yet, find a way to put some of these excellent ideas into action.</p>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>Your problems are not unique. Scratching your own itch and solving those problems, solves it for everyone else who faces the same thing. Also, when your product solves your own problems you know whether or not it’s good.</li>
	<li>When you fund your own company and work and rely on yourself, no one else can tell you what to do.</li>
	<li>Self-initiated projects show if it’s just a job or part of your life. They show if you really enjoy what you do.</li>
	<li>Interrupting someone says that what you have to say to them is more important than what they are working on.</li>
	<li>Treat your office like a library. Create an environment where you can learn and get things done.</li>
	<li>You don’t have a craftsman who builds furniture and hones his craft for 30 years, and then he goes and manages other craftsman doing the same thing. The same should be true for your company and your workers.</li>
	<li>When people are happier, they’re going to do better work</li>
	<li>Implementing REWORK in a corporate setting: Get projects done using the methodology and let others take notice.</li>
	<li>Working in a corporate environment is okay. If you like it stay; if you don’t work somewhere else.</li>
	<li>When you say no, say no early. No one wants to work on something for 3 months and then kill it. No is No to one thing; Yes is No to a lot of things.</li>
	<li>Recognize your creative times and utilize them wisely. </li>
	<li>When you work on something you don’t like, it’s not going to be any good.</li>
	<li>If you have a unique point of view, and do something in a different way, you can handle the competition.</li>
	<li>Build something that solves problems, not something that meets specs.</li>
	<li>Less is always an option.</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p>How [an artist] works and the materials used are not so important. You may use oil or tempera; you may paint in tone, or you may use only line—that is irrelevant to your problem. How you think is most important.</p>
<span class="source"><a href="http://todaysinspiration.blogspot.com/2011/01/heres-idea-think.html">Earl Oliver Hurst</a></span>
</blockquote>			<p>In my junior year of college I took a watercolor class. People talked about two main things concerning this class. One was the teacher, an extremely skilled Chinese man with an awesome goatee, who some students feared and some students loved. The other was the cost of all the materials you needed for class: paint and brushes and paper, among other things. It was one of the most expensive courses to take.</p>				

<p>I remember the lecture that our teacher gave us that first day of class, one that he referred to for the rest of the course. The crux of it was this: even though we invested in good tools for our painting, the tools themselves would not make our painting better. &ldquo;The brush will only do what you make it do. You are in control of the brush, right? The brush is not in control of you?&rdquo; If ever someone struggled with getting the technique correct, he would remind us sarcastically and humorously, and also right on point,&ldquo;Oh, it must be something wrong with your brush. That’s why you can’t do it.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="note out one-alt">
<p>I really was bad at watercolor. Like really, really bad. <cite>Like Highlander 2</cite> bad.</p>
</div>

<p>It was hard to swallow for some people (I always thought it was kind of funny, even though I was terrible at watercolor), but this statement was simple and true. You control your tools. Your tools themselves will not make you better at what you do. You can have the most exquisitely made paint brush in the world, but it won’t make you a good painter. I do believe in buying good tools, and I think that quality in your tools is important&#8212;a computer that constantly crashes will get in the way of your work&#8212;however, they will not in themselves make you better. That is up to you.</p>

<p>Likewise, learning how to make cooler textures in Photoshop won’t make you a better designer, and buying a Mac and TextMate won’t make you a better programmer. Your ability to learn new things, to think critically about what you do and who you are, and to do things you already know better and better are what counts. Regardless of your craft, your skill rests in your own hands.</p><blockquote>

But then, someone tells you that you don&rsquo;t have the time or resources to do it by the next release. The bomb has been dropped, what are you going to do?</p>

<p>I think in this moment there are three main routes you can take.</p>

<h2>You Don&rsquo;t Do It</h2>
<p>Sometimes that thing you think you need so badly isn&rsquo;t even something you really need. If you&rsquo;ve put in the time and thought that my dramatic intro suggests you have probably already vetted the feature pretty thoroughly. But you can use the &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t do it&rdquo; moment as an opportunity to sanity check yourself. Is this truly useful for our users? Maybe it&rsquo;s from an old parking lot list of features, and it&rsquo;s not even relevant anymore. It&rsquo;s never bad to ask yourself this question, even if you&rsquo;ve been thinking and planning a feature for a while, or even if you perceive it as important in the moment.</p>

<p>Another good question to ask yourself is, &ldquo;Do I really need this right now?&rdquo; We sometimes have a bad habit of solving problems we don&rsquo;t have yet. It makes sense, we&rsquo;re always thinking about users and the problems they&rsquo;ll encounter, or our system and the little things we want to perfect and offer users to make their experience better and better. Those problems might be real, but sometimes they&rsquo;re just not a problem <em>yet</em>. It&rsquo;s always good to ask this to ensure that you don&rsquo;t paralyze yourself for no reason.</p>


<h2>Do Something Else</h2>
<p>At the core of this feature should be a value to the users of your product. At its core, you should be solving a problem. The next option is to find a different way to solve that problem. This means it&rsquo;s time to get really creative with how you approach this thing. It&rsquo;s time to think about it from a totally different slant. It&rsquo;s time to go all MacGyver on it, look at what you have available, and still craft an awesome solution. This can actually lead to something great. Maybe you were making it too complicated and you find it should actually be simpler, or maybe you find an easier, faster way to solve it. This can be a great way to keep yourself sharp and really analyze your work and the steps involved in it.</p>


<h2>Lay the Groundwork</h2>
<p>This can piggyback off the last two routes, or can stand on its own. This is where you ask the question, &ldquo;Is there something we can do now that will make this easy to implement later?&rdquo; That feature might need a foundation to stand on before it should even be brought to life, a foundation that you haven&rsquo;t built yet. This is a great opportunity to break your feature down into its simplest pieces and tackle it step by step. Maybe it&rsquo;s not as complex as you think, maybe it&rsquo;s more complex. Either way, this allows you to get easy wins, create momentum, and really knock the thing out, which is what you want in the first place. No one loves a long, drawn out project. Turn your large project into a set of easy wins, however, and you can plow through it.</p>

<br>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to panic or get offended or angry when you&rsquo;re told that you can&rsquo;t do something. But inside that moment, there is opportunity. You just have to keep your wits about you, stay calm, and think it through. Your job is important and what you do matters, but chances are a feature on a website isn&rsquo;t a life or death situation. Transform that problem into an opportunity to do something better and into an opportunity to challenge yourself and grow.</p>)</h4>

  <h4 class="low-top"><a href="/tags/tools">tools</a> (<p>In my junior year of college I took a watercolor class. People talked about two main things concerning this class. One was the teacher, an extremely skilled Chinese man with an awesome goatee, who some students feared and some students loved. The other was the cost of all the materials you needed for class: paint and brushes and paper, among other things. It was one of the most expensive courses to take.</p>				

<p>I remember the lecture that our teacher gave us that first day of class, one that he referred to for the rest of the course. The crux of it was this: even though we invested in good tools for our painting, the tools themselves would not make our painting better. &ldquo;The brush will only do what you make it do. You are in control of the brush, right? The brush is not in control of you?&rdquo; If ever someone struggled with getting the technique correct, he would remind us sarcastically and humorously, and also right on point,&ldquo;Oh, it must be something wrong with your brush. That’s why you can’t do it.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="note out one-alt">
<p>I really was bad at watercolor. Like really, really bad. <cite>Like Highlander 2</cite> bad.</p>
</div>

<p>It was hard to swallow for some people (I always thought it was kind of funny, even though I was terrible at watercolor), but this statement was simple and true. You control your tools. Your tools themselves will not make you better at what you do. You can have the most exquisitely made paint brush in the world, but it won’t make you a good painter. I do believe in buying good tools, and I think that quality in your tools is important&#8212;a computer that constantly crashes will get in the way of your work&#8212;however, they will not in themselves make you better. That is up to you.</p>

<p>Likewise, learning how to make cooler textures in Photoshop won’t make you a better designer, and buying a Mac and TextMate won’t make you a better programmer. Your ability to learn new things, to think critically about what you do and who you are, and to do things you already know better and better are what counts. Regardless of your craft, your skill rests in your own hands.</p>)</h4>

Really these things are just pieces of truly building an accessible and flexible web for our users. I think we have come full circle to where we started. We have a better idea what is ahead of us, and even then, we are only at the beginning. Here are some of my favorite quotes from the article.</p>

<blockquote><p>The control which designers know in the print medium, and often desire in the web medium, is simply a function of the limitation of the printed page. We should embrace the fact that the web doesn’t have the same constraints, and design for this flexibility.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The flexibility I’ve talked about so far I think of as “adaptability“. Everything I’ve said so far could be summarized as: make pages which are adaptable. Make pages which are accessible, regardless of the browser, platform or screen that your reader chooses or must use to access your pages.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The web’s greatest strength, I believe, is often seen as a limitation, as a defect. It is the nature of the web to be flexible, and it should be our role as designers and developers to embrace this flexibility, and produce pages which, by being flexible, are accessible to all.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Future-friendly thinking encompasses lots of ideas: web standards, content strategy, progressive enhancement, responsive design, and more. However, it&rsquo;s far bigger than any one approach, technology or technique. It&rsquo;s here to help us think beyond our current project scopes and help us prepare for a future filled with innovation and constant change.</p></blockquote>

<p>Have a vision and strategy that serves your users well, code flexibly with a solid structure, and embrace opportunities to make things better for others today and in the future.</p>)</h4>

  <h4 class="low-top"><a href="/tags/work">work</a> (<p>Oh, how I love this article. May it bring us all down to earth and put us to actually making things that solve problems and add value&mdash;a novel concept in some circles.</p>

	<p>When you go too far up, abstraction-wise, you run out of oxygen. Sometimes smart thinkers just don't know when to stop, and they create these absurd, all-encompassing, high-level pictures of the universe that are all good and fine, but don't actually mean anything at all. </p>

	<p>These are the people I call Architecture Astronauts. It's very hard to get them to write code or design programs, because they won't stop thinking about Architecture. They're astronauts because they are above the oxygen level, I don't know how they're breathing. They tend to work for really big companies that can afford to have lots of unproductive people with really advanced degrees that don't contribute to the bottom line.</p>

</blockquote><p>Throughout my short professional career I&rsquo;ve always thought of myself as living two lives. There&rsquo;s the world at work at the office with paychecks and cubicles and things I have to do, and the world that is all the other things in my life, my friends and family and hobbies, all the things I really enjoy. Work is this compartmentalized, self-contained thing that I have to do for forty hours a week simply because to function in society you must have money and therefore you must have a job. I&rsquo;ve always found my jobs ultimately disappointing and unfulfilling, but told myself that it&rsquo;s okay because it&rsquo;s just this thing I have to do, and I can leave it behind each day when I get home. But that never really worked for me if I&rsquo;m truly honest with myself, and I now realize I couldn&rsquo;t be more wrong in regard to this philosophy.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that I hate the profession I&rsquo;m in by any means. In fact, I love being a web designer, which to me is one part design and one part code. As I sat in my Drawing 3 class in college, and we began discussing whether or not spilled coffee on the carpet is in fact a drawing, I knew one hundred percent that I was a designer. I have enjoyed design from the moment I took my first course in it and started learning what it actually is, but in this moment for the first time I called myself a designer. I didn&rsquo;t want to sit and contemplate the spilled coffee, I wanted to solve problems and meet needs and goals.</p>

<div class="note out one-alt">
	<p>Yes, we really talked about spilled coffee being a drawing. After all, it makes a mark on a surface. I think I called it a mistake and a tragedy (because of wasted coffee), not a drawing.</p>
</div>

<p>Then there&rsquo;s the other half of my job, the coding. At my last job I was in a pure development position for about a year and a half. As I was learning more about actual programming and scripting, something hit me—I love programming too. The more I learn about it, the more I love it. That you can write a function to solve a problem, pass it some arguments, and then it always gives you the same result—that&rsquo;s beautiful to me. I have coded for years, and always enjoyed writing HTML and CSS and JavaScript, but now as the web has matured, the capabilities at our hands have matured too, and it affords some amazing opportunities. Opportunities to learn something new every day, and to improve our craft each day. I love it.</p>

<p>So after this love fest, where does the whole realization and being wrong part come in? Well, I love my profession but not necessarily the conditions in which I&rsquo;ve practiced it. I realize that I&rsquo;ve always just sought a J-O-B, a paycheck, security, etc. I&rsquo;ve never been all that intentional with choosing where I want to work. I find something available, convince myself that it&rsquo;s tolerable, and go for it. Then I end up being tired, stressed, and miserable at work. Then I feel guilty for that because shouldn&rsquo;t I just be happy that I have a job and a paycheck, and why can&rsquo;t I be just like everyone else and realize a job is just a necessary thing in life, and after all I can go do it and leave it behind each day when I walk in the door at home. Not feeling fulfilled and feeling guilty because of feeling guilty for not feeling fulfilled is a weird little conundrum of a situation.</p>

<p>Then I read an awesome book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Quitter-Jon-Acuff/dp/0982986270/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1330825488&sr=8-1"><i>Quitter</i></a>, by <a href="http://jonacuff.com">Jon Acuff</a>, and he, being a far better writer than I am, nailed how I&rsquo;ve always felt about my forty hour hour dilemma. It&rsquo;s really quite simple: what you do at work does affect what you do at home. You have one life, and your work is a big chunk of it.</p>

<p>Just come out and admit it. It is a big part of your life, and it affects you. If you took any other activity and told someone that you spent forty hours a week doing it, that you spent the majority of your waking hours each day doing it, that you let it take you away from your family and anything else you might spend that time doing, and then at the end said, "Yeah, but it isn&rsquo;t really part of my life,"&mdash;that person would think your nuts. So why use this argument with our jobs?</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t listen in meetings at work and tune it out, then you don&rsquo;t listen to your wife when you&rsquo;re at home because you tune her out. If you sit zoned out staring at a computer screen all day, then you sit zoned out staring at your television at night. If you&rsquo;re lazy at work, then you&rsquo;ll be lazy in every other aspect of your life. You just can&rsquo;t separate it. Your life is one complete thing.</p>

<p>So now what do I do, equipped with my new knowledge? I don&rsquo;t have that totally figured out, but I do know that I must work, work, work. After I read <i>Quitter</i> over this past Christmas, I decided that I&rsquo;m tired of having a pile of work that I don&rsquo;t do but want to do. I&rsquo;m tired of only saying that I want to do more freelance work and spend time learning more about my craft. I&rsquo;m actually going to do it.  I&rsquo;ve gotten up at 5am every weekday and put in an hour of learning and work before I start the eight hour day ahead of me. Most days I spend lunch reading and learning new skills instead of going out to lunch. And I continue to try my best to push my work more and more with each project at the day job. I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;ll end up, but I&rsquo;m not stopping. I&rsquo;ve already found that being more diligent and intentionally putting time into the things that I&rsquo;ve always said matter to me gives me more energy and makes me feel less aimless. It&rsquo;s time to stop sitting around and wasting time. I feel more awake than ever. We&rsquo;ll see what happens from here.</p><p>I love <a href="http://www.creativemornings.com">Creative Mornings</a>. Creative Mornings is a monthly lecture series for creative-type folks. They take place all over the world, and they&rsquo;re all available on Vimeo for free. That means you have no excuse not to watch them.</p>

<p>I wrote down some notes from <a href="http://vimeo.com/28150404">Jason Fried’s talk</a> a few months ago, and then never published them because I&rsquo;m a wimp and second guess everything I want to put on this site. So without further adieu, here are my notes. You should go watch this and take your own notes too. Better yet, find a way to put some of these excellent ideas into action.</p>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>Your problems are not unique. Scratching your own itch and solving those problems, solves it for everyone else who faces the same thing. Also, when your product solves your own problems you know whether or not it’s good.</li>
	<li>When you fund your own company and work and rely on yourself, no one else can tell you what to do.</li>
	<li>Self-initiated projects show if it’s just a job or part of your life. They show if you really enjoy what you do.</li>
	<li>Interrupting someone says that what you have to say to them is more important than what they are working on.</li>
	<li>Treat your office like a library. Create an environment where you can learn and get things done.</li>
	<li>You don’t have a craftsman who builds furniture and hones his craft for 30 years, and then he goes and manages other craftsman doing the same thing. The same should be true for your company and your workers.</li>
	<li>When people are happier, they’re going to do better work</li>
	<li>Implementing REWORK in a corporate setting: Get projects done using the methodology and let others take notice.</li>
	<li>Working in a corporate environment is okay. If you like it stay; if you don’t work somewhere else.</li>
	<li>When you say no, say no early. No one wants to work on something for 3 months and then kill it. No is No to one thing; Yes is No to a lot of things.</li>
	<li>Recognize your creative times and utilize them wisely. </li>
	<li>When you work on something you don’t like, it’s not going to be any good.</li>
	<li>If you have a unique point of view, and do something in a different way, you can handle the competition.</li>
	<li>Build something that solves problems, not something that meets specs.</li>
	<li>Less is always an option.</li>
