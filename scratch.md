http://nickpruitt.com/work/tgp/ - This is an announcement site that I created two months ago at LifeWay for a new curriculum due out this fall. The purpose of this site was to describe the curriculum overall and to encourage signups for the pilot. I was given artwork and branding guidelines and was responsible for the design and front end code.

http://nickpruitt.com/work/vbs2012/ - I made this site for LifeWay last summer for the announcement of the theme for Vacation Bible School. Again I was provided some artwork, and I was responsible for the design and front end coding. My personal favorite page is http://nickpruitt.com/work/vbs2012/amazing-wonders/biblical-content.php, because I was able to use the theme to create a more unconventional layout.

nickpruitt.com - This is my personal site. It's my personal playground, a site I work on for myself. Right now it's only a single page blog, but I'm proud of the code and some of the small touches I've worked in so far.
