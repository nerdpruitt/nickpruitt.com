PRODUCTS

* Someone, a real human being has a job to do, a thing which needs to be done
* The software provides a way for them to complete that job
* I tend to really appreciate Ryan Singer's definition of UI Design
    You can define UI very precisely. An interface is a place where two things meet: the human and the computer. The computer has functions it can perform. The human needs inputs and outputs to take advantage of those functions. The interface is the arrangement of inputs and outputs that enable people to apply the computerâ€™s functions to create outcomes they want.
* And this is what the product is. It provides inputs and outputs around a common set of problems, and helps a user to accomplish what they need to accomplish.
* At the end of the day our job is to serve and help people, and to delight them as we do it.
